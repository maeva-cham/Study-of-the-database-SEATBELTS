# Study-of-the-database-SEATBELTS

# INTRODUCTION 

The United Kingdom is currently one of the safest countries in Europe in terms of road safety. The number of deaths per kilometer driven is much lower. How did they achieve such excellent results? these results are the result of a scientific study on numerous datasets. we will focus on one Dataset in particular: Seatbelts.
The seatbelts study is a study conducted on the wearing of seatbelts of drivers. This series gives monthly totals of car drivers in Britain killed or seriously injured from January 1969 to December 1984. As a result of this study the compulsory wearing of seatbelts was introduced on 31 January 1983. We can assume that researchers have asked themselves this question: What are the factors that could cause road accidents? What is the necessity of wearing a seatbelt? The data provide useful insights not only into the effect of seatbelts, but also into driving habits in general.
First, we will present the data and introduce the study to you. In a second time, we represent you the dataset in graphic form. we will be able to deduce some hypothesis from it. In the third part, we are going to test the hypothesis that we described before. In the last part, we will see how to adapt the model in order to reduce the number of road accidents.
